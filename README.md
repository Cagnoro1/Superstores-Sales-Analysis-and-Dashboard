## Project Overview
The project aims to analyze the key performance Indicators (KPI) of the sales data from the Superstore database to give them recommendations to increase their revenue and profit. The data ranges from 2014 to 2017. The project is divided into two parts: 
1) The customer segmentation Analysis  using SQL.
2) The visualization Dashboard on Tableau.

## Tools
* Microsoft SQL Server (SQL) -  used as the primary tool for data analysis. SQL queries were written and executed to extract, manipulate, and analyze the data stored in the "Superstore" table (database).
* Azure Data Studio - used to host MSSQL
* Microsoft Excel - Data cleaning, Data Analysis
* Tableau - Create Dashboard Report

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Microsoft Excel was used to clean this data. Here is what was done:
- Added filters to each column
- Separated "Order Date" by Day Month and Year.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explored the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

1) Let's start by grouping sales by category.
2) Let's group sales across the years.
3) Let's group sales across the years for each category.
4) Let's see in which month they operated the least.
5) Let's see with which discount they generate the more revenue.
6) What was the best month for sales in a specific year, and how much was earned in that month?
7) What type of products do they sell the most (classic) from 2014 to 2017?
8) Who are our best customers?
9) What are the top-selling products overall?
10) What are the top-selling products by Category and subcategory?
11) Profitability Analysis - Which products generate the highest profit?
12) Customer Segmentation - What are the main customer segments?
13) Regional Performance - What are the total sales and profit by Region?
14) Shipping Analysis- What are the most commonly used shipping models?
15) Discount Impact - What effect do discounts have on profit?
16) Time Trends - Are there any seasonal trends in sales or profit?
17) Customer Loyalty - List the loyal customers.
18) Product Portfolio Optimization - What are the underperforming products?

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
#### 1. Holiday Season Optimization:
- Consider focusing marketing efforts during the holiday season, which spans from March to November and December. This period consistently sees higher sales.
  
#### 2. Product Sales and Cost Optimization:
- The superstore should strategically manage its product offerings. Phones, chairs, storage, tables, binders, machine accessories, and copiers contribute significantly to sales revenue.
- To further optimize revenue, the superstore could negotiate deals with suppliers to reduce costs associated with these high-selling items.

#### 3. Geographic Expansion:
- California, Texas, and New York are the primary states for sales. Expanding store locations in these states could capitalize on existing demand.
- Tailoring products to the specific demographics of these regions, especially in high-traffic areas, may yield better results.

#### 4. Technology Category Investment:
- The Technology category generates substantial revenue. Investing more in tech supplies could enhance overall profitability.
  
#### 5. Consumer vs. Home Office Revenue:
- Consumers contribute more revenue than home offices. The superstore should continue to prioritize consumer-oriented products.
